<CENTER><FONT COLOR=white>Using 3D printing to build homes provides numerous benefits, including a decrease in construction time due to the machine's efficiency. During the process, concrete is extruded from a large machine into layers that form the walls, foundation and footing of the home.  The most popular material by far is 3D printing concrete. However, this is just a very broad term for mixtures that involve cement, fibers and other ingredients mixed in with water. Other materials include castable clay, mortar, synthetic polymers, and even regular old plastic (recycled). Because of their precision, 3D-printer builds typically produce far less waste and require much less cement than a conventional build. They can also be more easily customised to allow for better ventilation and draft-proofing, meaning they are naturally cool in the summer and warm in the winter.<BR>

3D-printed houses are created using very large 3D printers that, unlike smaller hobbyist or other types of industrial units, are able to extrude concrete, plastic, or other building materials through nozzles, in order to gradually build up a 3D object the size of a house.  There are five main benefits of 3D printing technology when it comes to building houses: 1. Lower cost – 3D buildings have the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of materials and labour. One house in China was successfully built for less than $5,000.  A 3D printer can build the walls of a house in as little as two days versus weeks or months with traditional construction materials.
