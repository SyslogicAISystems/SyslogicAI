<CENTER><FONT COLOR=white>This is where Artificial Intelligence comes into play and can be compared to the human brain, and the actual goal of Artificial Intelligence is for a self-driving car to conduct in-depth learning.  Artificial intelligence and the car In a 'natural' progression, artificial intelligence technology will increasingly be integrated into modern cars Expect that as AI makes driving easier and less stressful, removing the pain points, much of the paranoia will disappear, but are there consequences?  Researchers have lots of reasons for touting a future full of self-driving cars. They'll make road travel safer; they'll reduce traffic congestion; they'll allow passengers to safely do the things drivers are already doing, like text messaging in the car.<BR>

5 big challenges that self-driving cars still have to overcome<BR>
1) Creating (and maintaining) maps for self-driving cars is difficult work.<BR> 
2) Driving requires many complex social interactions — which are still tough for robots.<BR> 
3) Bad weather makes everything trickier. Compounding these challenges is the fact that weather still is a problem.<BR>
4) We may have to design regulations before we know how safe self-driving cars really are.<BR> 
5) Cyber security will likely be an issue — though a surmountable one<BR>
